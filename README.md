# GenerativeAI-Seminar
2 Day Generative AI Seminar Material

## Introduction
“Generative AI is easy!” Look at ChatGPT, you ask a question, you get an answer! How difficult could it be?
Well, for you as an individual, it is very easy and simple to use, but for an enterprise to allow the use of Generative AI, it is very involved to make sure all the pieces involved are secure, scalable, and extensible. There are servers, clusters, APIs, Agents, Datasources, Prompts, Orchestrators, Embedding Models, Vectorization Databases, and many other endpoints that must be put in place and secured to provide reliable answers to questions using Generative AI in a private and secure setting for an organization.

### Embeddings models
Discussion on how they work as algorithms that convert high-dimensional data into low-dimensional vectors. This process is called dimensionality reduction, which simplifies data and makes it easier for machine learning algorithms to process.

### Lab on using Embedding Models to orchestrate a conversation.
### Vectorization
A view into the concept of Vectorization, also known as **word embedding**, and demonstrating the process of converting text data into numerical vectors. These vectors are used to build machine learning models where they can be used for Word Predictions, Similarities and Natural Languages.

### Lab on using Vectorization to orchestrate a conversation.
### Vactorization Databases
- Azure AI Search
- PineCone
- Chroma
- Faiss
- Azure Postgresql 

### Lab on using Vectorization Databases to orchestrate a conversation.
### Red Teaming
Explanation of what a Red Team and Security Hardening encompasses from a multi-layered attack simulation that uses a variety of tools, tactics, and strategies to breach defenses to reducing the attack surface for malicious actors.
