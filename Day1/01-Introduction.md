# Introduction to Generative AI
## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is Artificial Intelligence capability that can be used to create new content

## LLMs, their purpose and their capabilities

A Language Model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.
- Language Modeling is the task of predicting of what comes next after a sequence of words. 
- What should be the next words = Word with the highest probability.
- It is super super smart autocomplete.
- LLM is similar concept but with significant amount of data that it has been trained on based on billions of parameters
- ChatGPT LLM uses 175 billion parameters (GPT-3.5) Vs 1.5 Trillion Parameters for GPT-4
- ChatGPT does NOT understand what you write
- it uses statistical models in the LLM to predict what response is the best for what you ask.

## What is GPT?
Generative Pre-trained Transformer, models from OpenAI with the help of Microsoft.

GPT-3.5 has 175 Billion parameters and is cheaper to use than GPT-4
GPT-4 has 1.5 Trillion parameters and is considered the most advanced model to use as of the start of 2024 https://openai.com/research/gpt-4 It was built with the help of Microsoft

## What is Hallucination?
In the context of Machine Learning, particularly in the field of Language Model Learning Machines (LLMs), a hallucination refers to a situation where the model generates information that is not **grounded** in the input data or factual reality.  Essentially, the model "hallucinates" details or connections that are not present in the given context.

## What are Genrative AI Policies?
Generative AI Policies are the rules and guidelines that govern the use of AI models that generate content. These policies are designed to ensure that the content generated by AI models is ethical, safe, and aligned with the values of the organization or society. Generative AI Policies may include guidelines on data privacy, fairness, transparency, and accountability, as well as restrictions on the use of AI models for harmful or malicious purposes.

It is important to adhere to AI policies even though they change so fast as we are still in the era of discovery mode of what is allowed and what is not allowed.  For example OpenAI has a much evolving usage policies that you should keep an eye on while building your agents, apps and infrastructure. Take a look here https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies

## What does Fine Tuning Mean?
Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a new task or dataset. This involves updating the parameters of the pre-trained model using the new data, so that the model can make more accurate predictions on the new task. Fine-tuning is a common technique in machine learning, especially for tasks where there is limited training data available.

Sometimes the need for internal data is needed beyond the access to the data the LLM was trained on like email inboxes for a company, internal documentation, Human Resources information...  

The Data Collection aspect is very important in Fine Tuning:

- Relevant Data collected
- Security, do you have enough guard rails around the data for protection?
- Privacy, does the data has personal identifiable characteristics that should not be included, is it bias, does it discriminate?
- Unique, make sure the fine tuning is based on unique data otherwise the data already in the LLM could be sufficient.
- Preprocessing, that is the case in every project, the data is dirty, like any other data analytics job, cleaning the data and getting it ready is a major step to get a superior experience with your Fine Tuned LLM

## So what is OpenAI after all?
OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Their mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.  Making a few bucks while at it, did not seem like a bad idea lately :) 

## What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It was based on the GPT-3.5 architecture and now is also available on GPT-4 and is designed to generate human-like responses to text inputs. ChatGPT can be used for a wide range of conversational applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems. It is available as an API that developers can integrate into their applications to enable natural language interactions with users.

### Important Characteristics of ChatGPT:
- ChatGPT is a product developed by OpenAI. It is one of the language models in the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series created by OpenAI. 
- ChatGPT is specifically fine-tuned for conversational interactions, making it adept at generating human-like text in a dialogue format
- ChatGPT uses WebText for its training data
- Contains ~ 8 million scraped web pages
- Emphasis on document quality
- based on outbound links from Reddit which received at least 3 karma
- Currently, for GPT-3.5, it is only aware of data until September 2021. The based on GPT-4 is more recent ~ March 2022 (OpenAI did not disclose the exact date or the amount of parameters used in GPT-4)
- Was trained using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback)
- So other than the 8 million scraped web pages it uses Human AI Trainers with a reward model to train the LLM
