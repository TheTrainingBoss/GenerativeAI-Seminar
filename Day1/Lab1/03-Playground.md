## OpenAI Playground
Head over to https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat to start playing with the OpenAI Playground. This is a great way to get a feel for how the OpenAI API works and to start experimenting with different prompts and responses.

Try to ask the model to prepare a travel itinerary for you, or ask it to summarize a book you've read. You can also ask it to generate a poem or a short story. The possibilities are endless!

Change models, Temperatures, Max Tokens, and Top P to see how the model responds to different inputs. You can also try using different prompts to see how the model generates different outputs.
